<h2>The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread (for programmers anyways)</h2>
  Imagine a world where for every program you had to code, you were forced to start from scratch every single time. A world where repetitive code never existed and essentially you had to create from the ground up. That world would be an actual nightmare and would be almost as awful as coding using punch cards like people used to do long ago. Thankfully we donâ€™t live in a world like that and we have a thing called design patterns. This glorious topic has given us the ability to save our time to focus on what actually makes our applications different rather than do the tedious task of re-doing the work that either we or another person has done that is similar to the application in progress. We can take a look at how another programmer has designed their code and use it in a way that makes your own code more readable and It is like the first person that made sliced bread. Life before that moment must've been miserable because in order to make a sandwhich, you'd have to do it yourself. Now, you won't even believe how life could have ever existed without this invention. This is like design patterns. Without it, we wouldn't be able to be as creative and thoughtful and accelerated as we are today.

<h2>A Brief Inquiry Into Repetitive Code</h2>
  There are many different design patterns that humans have created that are reusable in certain situations that really make life as a programmer so much simpler. There are over 20 types that almost all programmers are currently using on a daily basis. We will always strive to build applications faster because time is money, and employers don't want us wasting time attempting to redesign something that is similar to what is currently out there. Instead we could use a pattern that is used often for the multitude of applications that we are trying to create. For example, some really common design patterns are singletons, abstracts and factories. Theses are essentially creational patterns that mainly for class instantiation which is common in some computing languages. They are used very often with the exception of a project that maybe would be best to use a different design pattern such as MVC for more architectural type of patterns. There is some distaste for using design patterns, especially when inexperienced programmers attempt to copy the code for their project when they don't necessarily understand the inner workings of it. It can be tricky to take this route because technically the project won't always work as intended when changes are needed to be made.

<h2>Hey, Actually I Am Familiar with Design Patterns</h2>
  Crazily enough, the use of design patterns were right under our noses. Like in Scooby-Doo when they catch the bad guy, it is usually someone the gang doesn't expect. Especially for me, I have never noticed that I have always been using a pattern that was really common until using the Digits application and the Meteor React Template for the project. That pretty much is what a design pattern is though. Simply a template. A rough blueprint that is applicable to many situations that simplifies the thought process. These applications were presented to us as starting points to understand which files connect to each other. I found it to be very helpful when learning about databases and the use of react in an application because it has allowed me to see the subtle differences into what makes the pattern special.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  Design Patterns have given us the ability to make other programmers feel comfortable with the familiarity with an application so that they won't be so intimidated by. But we can also showcase our own personal invention to make something that is different, but same. By that, I mean we will always take elements of how we create things and implement them into our own code so that it is easier for others that want to look under the hood to understand what makes it similar to any other. It is an incredible feeling when the code works as intended and even better that it is familiar to our peers to see something that doesn't look like complete gibberish. There is actually a solid structure when we use these design patterns and it allows use to work with others easier since we would be on the same page when creating a massive application. It would be a disaster otherwise. The bread that we have always desired now comes to us sliced. The ease of using a design pattern has improved the lives of programmers everywhere.
