<h2>Coding Standards as a Whole</h2>

Coding standards, in my opinion, are very important to everyone within the programming field because it improves readability with the code and keeps everyone in check. That means that everyone would be on the same page when it comes to the way code is written. I also believe that it does help when learning a language to an extent because the form of how loops and functions are created would be the same everywhere. If people had different ways of writing a loop, then it would be problematic if there were people collaborating on a certain project because it would be troubling to make sense of it and keep track of how the code is supposed to work. 
  
<h2>Thoughts on ESLint</h2>

After using ESLint and trying to get used to the standards it uses, I actually really enjoy it because it points out where spaces are needed to make my code more readable for not only others, but also for me when I need to look back at what i've written. It's really nice that it is really strict when something is out of place or if something is missing because visually it looks many times better. it shows as an error in your code. In some languages, even though semantically your code may be correct, the syntax of it could change the little things that go on within the computer such as memory and stuff like that. So having a standard even helps with the way your code works in certain cases. Although, for Javascript, the missing spaces don’t matter too much since it is a powerful language and ESLint is pretty much for our sake of making code look better and more readable. It is a really useful tool that I wish I had known about earlier because it really does make like easier. Feels like there's magic involved when using this tool. 

<h2>The Desired Green Checkmark</h2>

Getting the green checkmark isn’t too difficult when it comes to the formatting of the code because I like to consider myself to have a little OCD and every little space or inconsistency just doesn’t sit well with me. It looks a hundred times better when code is uniform and the structure is consistent throughout the entire program. But when it does get difficult to reach that coveted green checkmark in the top right corner of the screen, ESLint makes it easier to rectify by using red bars to indicate exactly where the errors in your code are and also provides multiple suggestions on how to make it so that you can get the checkmark. Once that gets figured out, it is very satisfying to see that your code checks out and that your code is so readable that anyone could interpret its meaning without feeling confused. 

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

ESLint is a very well developed plugin for Javascript developers, especially ones who don't really stick to a standard when they code. It can be helpful for many beginner coders too because it would help them get the idea of a coding standard engraved in their brain and that would translate into being muscle memory. The training would start at the root of the their coding journey when it is easiest rather than having to transition to learning the standards when it is much more difficult to get used to something. There is pretty much almost no problems with ESLint because it does what it needs to do very well and efficiently. It is a good learning tool that should take advantage of because it is very beneficial to everyone to understand.
