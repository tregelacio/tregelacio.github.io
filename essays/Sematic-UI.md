<h2>From Humble Beginnings</h2>

Semantic UI at first glance looked like it could be a lot of fun to learn and scrolling through the simple keywords of the framework seemed like it would be a breeze to create very interesting pages. But, it was just the opposite. Going through each element of the framework felt like a giant tsunami wave of words and text, preventing me from fully understanding how each keyword affects the webpage. It was very overwhelming to try to understand how to morph the page into exactly what I want to create. But taking a step back and looking at all the tools the framework provides for me, it isn’t so much as I initially thought. Taking the time to learn the more important keywords such as a grid, container, etc would make life a lot easier because it allows you to form the sections that you want and make exactly what you want. Just like Kevin from The Office once said, “why waste time say lot work when few word do trick?” Once you know exactly how each word affects the format of the page, such as specifying how many columns or how large the columns are, then it would simplify your life when coding in html and css. Investing time to learn this framework may seem like a hassle at first, but once you understand how it works, you’ll forget the frustrations and start to appreciate it. Semantic UI is a great framework. It just takes a little bit of studying to be able to compose a solid webpage. 
  
<h2></h2>

During the beginning phase of my quest to learn Semantic UI, I feel like I heavily struggled trying to even create the simplest of webpages because I couldn't grasp how to create the invisible box of grids and position them where I want them to be. So far, I’ve taken the time to look through each element and test how they modify the page which gives me an overall idea of when would be the best time to use that certain element. Little by little, I would chip away at the more commonly used keywords and tried to get a better understanding so that hopefully I could be able to recall the perfect keywords for the job. There are more things that you can do that allows you to be more creative in a build. Currently, it feels as though there is still a lot to learn and get used to because there is a slight learning curve compared to basic html and css.

While you could argue that you could just use raw html and css to build a page, I feel like using an already built framework to add a little flair to the webpage is much better than just using the tools that the basics provide. Also, for the people reading the code, Semantic UI uses phrases that are closer to human speech rather than html code which can be a little tough to decipher especially with more complicated webpages. With the framework, however, the names of what you call each element is easily understandable. I really appreciate how its so seamless, such that the way the keywords can be concatenated together so that you can be more specific in what you want. 

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

Overall, learning a framework is a difficult task to do, but once you get the hang of it, it starts to feel like a cheat sheet. The way it already has built in aspects like buttons and forms is such a great thing because you don’t have to make that yourself in raw html and css. Having to mess with the positioning, sizing and the construction of something as simple as a bar is made a lot easier by using a framework. Luckily, we got to mess with Semantic UI and the simplicity of it. the built-in pieces. It’s so nice to use something that someone else made to make your own life easier because who would want to make their life more difficult than it already is?
