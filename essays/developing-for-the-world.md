  I’ve always had the dream of building a piece of technology that would be useful for everyone and hopefully it would have the power to save lives. Something that has more of an affect on people than just existing. I like to take my inspiration from tech legends who have done great things for our world and made history through their inventions such as Bill Gates with his intelligence to develop a widely used system or Elon Musk with his creativity furthering the advancement of humanity through revolutionary technology.

  As a young developer, I would like to develop the skills to be able to contribute to the organizations that are trying to make a positive impact on the world such like the people who have done it before. Also, since I’m currently inexperienced with developing some cool programs to be able to save the world, I haven’t had the best chance to make a huge difference like some of the other people I look up to. 

   On the technical side, I would like future me to be able to have the skill to solve difficult problems with ease, all while maintaining the knowledge to keep up with the updated aspects of the changing field of software engineering. Having to learn all the new updates with the multitude of all the different languages and parts of the field is difficult, but would also make your life easier.
