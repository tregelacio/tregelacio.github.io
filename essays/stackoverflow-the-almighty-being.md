  Smart questions are important for smart software engineers because as a developer, it is nearly impossible for anyone to remember how to fix any problem they have with the vast amount of information available. There will be people who specialize in certain aspects therefore, they have an easier time solving a problem. So using an open source community such as StackOverflow is good because it can help you with your problems. The only thing is that it has to be a question that makes the asker think how to solve it rather than straight up give the answer. That not only hurts yourself, but also hurts others who have the same question. It doesn’t benefit anyone in the long term. If the question is worded in a way where it forces the answer-giver to provide good insight to the question with another question, then it’ll be beneficial for everyone.
  An example of a smart question on stackoverflow is 

  Bad questions such as … don’t help the community in long run. It only helps the asker at that immediate time and place. These types of questions where the answer given is directly to the question do not help the person in the future. Perhaps once they run into that question again, they won’t remember how to solve it. So they’ll have to ask the same question again in order to get the direct answer without learning anything and learning from their mistakes.
