   A sudoku solver that takes in values from an incomplete sudoku puzzled solves it using recursion by inserting different values into the boxes until it is completely solved. If a single box up until a certain point doesn’t fit within the rules of sudoku then the program recursively goes back to that spot to test the next available number that is in the array. 

   This was an assignment given in a class that taught Intermediate Java. From here we learned about certain techniques that weren’t shown in the previous Java class. From this assignment, it was important that the recursive method worked perfectly as well as efficiently because with the three test sudoku puzzles, we had to make sure the last puzzle took the longest with the recursive method. The tests were designed so that we are able to visually see how long the puzzles would take and how they differ from each other.

   This project has given me a stronger understanding of recursion, which was one of the most difficult topics in the course. Trying to understand how to structure the recursive method was one of the challenges that I had that I overcame.
