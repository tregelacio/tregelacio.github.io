<h2 id="how">How It's Made</h2>
I used a couple python libraries that specialize in collecting information from the html code of websites and manipulating that information to be presented how you want it to. Basically, it checks for changes in the pricing of a particular shoe on a stock exchange like site called StockX. When there is a change in price or lowest ask, it opens up a new web browser so you'll be able to buy it immediately.

<h2 id="why">Reasons for Creating Project</h2>
I thought this project would be a fun way to get into scripting as looking and collecting sneakers is one of my hobbies and coding works well with the culture because a lot of purchases for rare and collectable shoes are mostly online. This site works as the middleman for people to buy and sell.
