Our game was similar to this, except in first person.

  This simple arcade shooting game was a creation I made for a final project in ICS 111, which was my first programming class at the University of Hawaii. Itâ€™s a point and click that has a loading screen, moving targets, a health system, a crosshair, integrated sound and a point system. You have the ability to hit all the targets moving and win, or if you fail to do so, you get a losing screen, but have the option to try again. 

  For this project, I was the lead programmer in a group of two people and was responsible for getting the images, developing the movement of the characters and crosshair, adding the visual effects and sound effects to occur on click, and the start and losing screen. I was also the leader of developing the ideas and integrating what we felt needed to be added in. Also had to plan out what should be completed by certain due dates since we had limited time to complete the project. 
  
  This project taught me about how to work in a group and communicate with a partner to build something efficient enough to be able to showcase in front a bunch of people. I also learned how to properly demonstrate how the code worked in front of the class. It was nerve-racking because we didn't know how the class would react to what we were showing them. Also being able to plan out the ideas to make something better for the future got difficult because we didn't know how to code a few features we wanted to add, so we had to simplify it for ourselves.
